# Time-Series-Analysis-for-climate-factors-in-Paris-2010-2020
As I reflect on my research project exploring the intricate relationship between mortality, pollution, and climate factors in Paris from 2010 to 2020, I'm struck by the human impact of our findings. Analyzing 508 data points, we delved into how environmental conditions like temperature and air quality affect human life. It was challenging to navigate the complex interactions, but using advanced statistical techniques such as Distributed Lag Models and State-Space Models, we managed to explain 38.09% of the data variation with our best model. What truly excites me about this work is its potential to inform public health policies. By developing forecasting methods, we're not just crunching numbers â€“ we're providing insights that could help communities understand and mitigate health risks associated with environmental changes. It's humbling to think that our statistical analysis could translate into practical knowledge that might one day save lives. This project has reinforced my passion for using data science to make a tangible difference in people's well-being.
